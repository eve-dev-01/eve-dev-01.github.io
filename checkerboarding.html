                        This page is a breakdown of my dissertation research! It's taken me deeper into rendering technology than anything before, and has been a great learning experience.

                        "Checkerboarded rendering" refers to a family of upsampling techniques that use a reduced size render-target, in conjuction with the previous full-frame render result to construct a new frame image from partially complete data.

                    The core of the technique is that alternating regions render in full detail every frame, with the rendered region flipping. Imagining the final presented image as a checkerboard, on one frame only the black squares would be truly rendered; on the next frame only the white.
					The rest of the output is inferred or reconstructed from other availalbe information.<br>

                    While many techniques use a compressed size render target (e.g. half width) with an offset viewport to achieve this, I use an alternate approach, which is a depth-prepass of sorts. We simply render the 2x2 black or white squares, at a set depth of 0, meaning nothing will ever pass their depth test. 
                    This is known as stencil- or depth-based checkerboarding.

                    The image shows a sample of the starting depth buffer, with each red and black square representing a 2x2 pixel region.

                    We also complete a motion pass; for each object, we provide its current object matrix, and the current view matrix, as well as what they were last frame. From this, we can calculate a difference in screen space, for a given pixel between frames.       
                    <br> 
                    The image provided is a representation but is not to be fully trusted; the vectors are so small due to the high frame rate that they don't show in a float format, PIX will only show them in integer formats, so these would be of a much smaller magnitude than suggested. This is solely for visualisation.

					Taking the motion for this frame and last frame, the depth for both frames, and the true renders for both frames, reconstruction can begin. It is a multi-step process, 
					based somewhat on Ubisoft's implementation for Rainbox Six | Siege.

					The motion buffer is traced back to find a 'reprojected' colour, an estimate of what the colour should be based on the previous frame's true render.

					Motion reprojection is not perfect; putting too much trust in it can lead to ugly colours or ghosting. Ghosting occurs motion is only drawn at the position an object is in the current frame. 
					<br><br>In the diagram, the orange region shows where motion is correctly rendered, outside is bad data. Sampling that outside edge may give a motion of zero, reprojecting to the object that has not moved away, giving ghosted edges.

					Motion reprojection is often unreliable. Objects move in front of others, and may obscure otherwise good reprojections. As such, we also check for coherency in depth. 
					Clamping against the neighbour pixels, we get an ideally safer reprojection. Then, based on depth similarity between the reprojection and this frame, we can blend back towards the true reprojected value.

					This processing is only completed on pixels that have some motion. Pixels with zero motion are assumed to have perfect reprojection.The image attached shows the effects of making colour clamping conditional on motion magnitude.
					<br>In the top row, all samples are clamped, leading to differences between frames; this creates a really nasty flickering effect. <br>
					On the bottom row, the samples are clamped only if the motion is of sufficient magnitude; these are much more stable.
