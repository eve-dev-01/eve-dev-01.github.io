						I spend a lot of my spare time playing board games. I know, get away from games and go right back to them, but there is something different about physical games. 
						Sharing the same physical space, touching the same components, often needing to read facial cues, or negotiate; its such a different type of experience to many video games. 
						I take a lot of enjoyment in exploring the rules of a new game, experiencing the design unfold, and discovering it's complexities with the rest of table. Some of the best 
						experiences come from being completely unable to comprehend how a game is won; a recent example is The King is Dead, a very tight game of conflict that sees players shifting allegiances 
						while bidding to control medieval Britain. I have never won, and that is what makes it so exciting.

						Part of the board gaming hobby is running my university's tabletop gaming society. I've been on the committee for just over 2 years now, and a member since I first enrolled at the university. 
						Running the group has been a great opportunity for growth; there's a lot to take care of, from the logistics of our 3 weekly events, to the planning and marketing of trips, the advertising and collaborations 
						that get people introduced to the group, and fostering a healthy environment that keeps people returning and feeling safe. It's been a great joy helping run the group, and I'm sad to know that I'll have to give it 
						up soon.

						Outside of gaming, I try to enjoy live music whenever possible. Sheffield is a blessing for this, with plenty of venues that host artists of all types of genre and popularity; it's a city with a great musical 
						heritage. Seeing Pulp live was an opportunity I never thought I'd have, after missing their first reunion tour, but to see them on home turf was an absolute joy, and definitely my highlight of 2023.
						I've recently attempted to make the jump from consumer to creator, and begun learning the guitar, although I think I have a long way to go. :)
