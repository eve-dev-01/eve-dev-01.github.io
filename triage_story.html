                        Triage Story is a game designed to train nurses to take mental health calls, ranging from outpatient check-ins to crisis calls with those at immediate risk. It was developed to 
                        client specifications, ensuring we follow clinical guidance, and is being trialled as a teaching tool soon. The game was developed by a 2 person team, of which I was the lead, 
                        so I was responsible for setting tasks and managing milestone deadlines, as well as contacting the client. I will only describe here that which I had a part in.

                    The game features 3 levels developed from amalgamations of real calls, provided to us by the client. From here, my colleague and I developed dialogue trees; the player is simply shown a computer screen with choices representing their possible replies. 
                    All of the patient lines are voice acted, and will play as the line is displayed; for one level this was over 170 separate voice lines!

                    The dialogue itself runs from the Yarn system, which can be found <b><a href="https://yarnspinner.dev/" style="color:white">here.</a></b> This is used to connect voice line assets to the appropriate text, and provides support for in-script variables. As the Triage Story scripts 
                    use only a subset of Yarn features, and we have set expectations on the usage of the system, we developed a script editor program, which can save and load scripts, as well as export them to Yarn files that can be put right into the game.

                    With a primary goal of the game being to educate through the gameplay, we need scoring systems that reflect the clinical goals of the situation. As such we have scores calculated from two sources; both where the conversation ends up, and from the in-script variables. We have extended the Yarn system 
                    to support specific score functions, which are declared at the top of the script and are evaluated at the end of the game. This would be in the format, for example, "rudeness &lt; 2". This would then give a point if the condition is met based on how the conversation went. This allows us to appraise not only the broad 
                    strokes of a players choices, but also some of the subtleties. Based on the score achieved, a medal grade is calculated, from bronze, silver or gold.

                    One of the game's best strengths is its web integration. Users are required to have an account before accessing the game; they can simply create one through the home page. This is because Triage Story logs 
                    player choices and achievements so that they can be reviewed at a later date. If a user were to play a given level 3 times, we can reconstruct a full transcript of that level from the data we have stored. At the end of the game, they can request an email transcript of their progress.

                    Alternatively, their past efforts can be viewed through the educator portal. Students can enter a unique code within the game to join a "cohort", with each cohort being linked to an educator account. An educator can 
                    view the data of the students that have signed up to the cohort, allowing them to sit down and talk about the evolution of a players choices over time. It may be clear that between the first and third time playing, a student has 
                    become notably more empathetic in their chosen replies, and having that data available to the educator enables those observations and the resulting conversations.

                    We achieve this with Azure Web Services; through this we host an Azure DB (managed with Code First Migrations) with a C# ASMX WebService interface. We use Unity's WebRequests to send secure requests to the services, which will then interact with the database. <br>
                    We also had to link a Gmail account to the web service so that we can send transcript and confirmation emails to users. These emails also required some basic JavaScript, with a little bit of AJAX. There were also a couple of instances of having to write raw SQL.

                    Triage Story has been a great project in terms of personal development; as someone who usually chooses not to engage with languages outside of C++, 
                    this was a great fresh challenge, touching a lot of technologies that I wouldn't have otherwise used. Working to client specifications, while also having the responsibility of 
                    making design decisions for the team was also new, but welcome.<br>
