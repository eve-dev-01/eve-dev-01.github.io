                        This work was completed as part of a module on multi-threading; the EP Engine features an Entity-Component-System framework, which strictly follows the set principles. Data and code are separate; an entity can have 0 or 1 of a given component; component references are not to be stored directly, favouring instead a temporally stable Entity ID.
                        <br><br>
                        Components use a hand built RTTI system; a macro in the struct definition adds in the data needed to run the RTTI, and a macro in a single cpp file initialises all the required static data, including registering the type to a central type information manager.

                    Each component type is given a unique ID, which is used to convert a type into data, using a function-level static variable in a templated function. Component space is only reserved for types that have been properly declared as component types in this way. <br>
                    Code can then request access to specific components through the framework provided.

                    Systems only execute when they are registered to the framework; at registration they must provide the IDs of every component type for which they require read-access or write-access. When code from a given system attempts to use a component type, these dependencies are checked, 
                    and enforced; the program will break if a system attempts to access a component for which it does not have permission.

                    Knowing the type dependencies of each system, we can develop a map of system-system dependencies; we can say system A is dependent on system B if system B writes to a type from which system A reads. This becomes a standard dependency graph, with respect to the accessed type.

                    Using this dependency graph, we can easily and safely delegate systems amongst multiple threads; we can guarantee that no two systems are contending for write access, and that no system is reading a component mid-write. For this, we have a job-system; the main thread acts as a manager, delegating work to 
                    worker threads, in the form of a system function pointer. Only when that system is complete does the manager thread remove a given system and its dependencies from the graph, potentially enabling another system to begin.

                    Internally, the manager thread signals a semaphore to wake up a given worker thread. The worker thread then completes the task it was set, and upon completion signals the manager thread. Upon waking, the manager thread cleans up workers that have finished, and delegates more tasks. 
                    This minimises thread dead time, and potentially costly mutex usage.
